I went to Yahoo.com it looked very 90 the look of the website was very dated and reminded me of the internet in the early times of the internet. It has changed a lot there were a lot of links on the home page but the website now is very clean looking.
Some of the things that I learned the last few topics was how to link different website. I think that it was pretty easy.
