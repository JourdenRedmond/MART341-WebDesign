This whole class was something that I had never thought of so learning about web development was all new to me. It was awesome to dive deeper into what goes into making a website. I learned a lot of new things about web design. It was awesome to see how to code a website and it was cool to get to take a class like this. I had a lot of challenges over the semester but I liked that you gave us examples because those really helped.
