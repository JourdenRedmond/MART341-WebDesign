         Hi there! My name is Jourden Redmond. And if you’re reading this then I guess you’re interested in learning about me, so here goes! I guess I’ll start from the beginning, seems logical right? Okay, so I’m from Billings,Montana.I grew up in a household with my parents and my sister. I did all of my schooling and then moved to Missoula in 2017.

         I am a Journalism major here at The University of Montana. I fell in love with journalism my senior year of high school after attending the Ohio State national championship game. The atmosphere of sports and the feeling of being in a place like that really opened my eyes to a careeer in an invironment like that.

        When I graduate college I hope to work for a sports team or network as either a reporter or a social media manager.

         Journalism has been such an eyeopening major and it has allowed me to create things that I never would have been possible.
