              The parents of Jacob Blake held a press conference Tuesday to speak about their son and the ongoing unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin.

Jacob Blake Jr. Was shot multiple times by a Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officer last Sunday evening. Protesters in Kenosha and elsewhere have demonstrated, demanding police accountability. Some of those protests have turned violent.

Jacobs family was emotional as they spoke about their son. His father Jacob Blake Sr’s voice was filled with emotion “They shot my son seven times, seven times like he didn’t matter, but my son matters.” he said.

The family also spoke about the recent violent protests that have erupted in Wisconsin and around the country. “As I was riding through the city, I noticed a lot of damage. It does not reflect my son or my family.” said Blakes mother Julia Jackson.

With her son fighting for his life in the hospital Jackson had one thing to ask of the country and Wisconsin. “So, I'm really asking everyone and encouraging everyone in Wisconsin and abroad to take a moment and examine your hearts. Citizens, police, firemen, clergy, politicians do Jacob justice on this level and examen your hearts. We need healing.”

              LEAD IN) THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC IS MAKING IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS TO PLAN AHEAD AS THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE NEXT SEMESTER LOOMS OVER THE UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA CAMPUS. 270 NEWS’ JOURDEN REDMOND HAS THE STORY
              (NAT SOUND MAIN HALL BELLS CHIMING)
              (REPORTER)  FALL SEMESTER IS ALMOST OVER AND IT HAS BEEN UNLIKE ANY SEMESTER THE WORLD HAS EVER SEEN.FRESHMAN JUST STARTING COLLEGE FIND IT ESPECIALLY DISORIENTING SAYS LILLY CENTER, A FRESHMAN FROM WHITEHALL, MONTANA.
              (BITE-CENTER)
              For me this was my first year it was really a difficult adjustment for sure living on campus just because things are you know so different this year, we have to kind of be extra cautious with everything and it’s definitely been a lot different than anything I've experienced.
              (REPORTER)
              THE NORMAL COLLEGE EXPERIENCE HAS DEFINITLY CHANGED AROUND CAMPUSES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WITH LIMITED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION MANY CLASSES HAVE MOVED STRICTLY ONLINE. COLLEGE STUDENTS HAVE HAD TO ADJUST TO A NEW NORMAL OF ONLINE LEARNING AND ZOOM. SOPHOMORE RORY MCLAVERTY SAYS ITS HARD TO STAY MOTIVATED WHEN THE REWARD FOR FINISHING HIS WORK IS JUST MORE TIME STUCK IN HIS ROOM.
              (BITE-MCLAVERTY)
              The biggest struggle I'd have to say would be that I don’t get the sense of accomplishment because when I get up and go somewhere, I feel accomplished and ready to go but if I'm just in my room on my computer I don’t get that sense of accomplishment or feeling that I'm doing something.
              (REPORTER)
              LILLY CENTER HAS HAD A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE AND AGREES THAT ONLINE LEARNING HAS HAD ITS CHALLENGES. BEING ISOLATED AND NOT BEING ABLE TO SOCIALIZE HAS HELD A HUGE WEIGHT DURING THIS SEMESTER.
              (BITE-CENTER)
              I don’t leave my dorm much and you kind of just have a hard time staying motivate, especially not leaving your space. I think the most challenging thing is just feeling so isolated and it’s pretty lonely and having all of these things going on around the world can be quite distracting. Its been tough just being alone all the time and stuff, you kind of start to feel a little sad and it has been really difficult to stay positive and stay encouraged and stuff like that.
              (REPORTER)
              AS THE FALL SEMESTER COMES TO A CLOSE AND STUDENTS TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO KEEP THEMSELVES HEALTHY OVER THE HOLIDAY BREAK, CORONAVIRUS CASES CONTINUE TO SOAR. MOST STUDENTS ARE UNSURE HOW TO PLAN FOR THE NEXT SEMESTER OF UNCERTAINTY.
              (ANCHOR TAG)
              ALTHOUGH THE UNIVERSITY HAS YET TO RELEASE THEIR PLAN FOR THE UPCOMING SPRING SEMESTER  STUDENTS AND STAFF ARE STILL STAYING PREPARED AND ARE REGISTERING FOR CLASSES AS NORMAL.
