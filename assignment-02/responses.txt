The world wide web is different from the internet because the Internet is a global network of different networks and the World wide Web is information that is accessed by the internet. 
The internet is a network that routes packages from a source computer to the destination computer. 
A directory is a files system that contains the refrences to other computer files. 
It benefits you because it it manages the computer programs, documents and other collections of information. 

My favourite kind of art is graphic art I love graphic design and I really like the process of making it.
